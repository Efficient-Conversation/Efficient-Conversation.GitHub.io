<h4>History of Efficient Conversation</h4>
<p>
    This group of people started out on Steam around 2009, calling each other every day and slowly adding people to the call as they came online. 
    Eventuallly we got smart and made a Steam group so people could join and leave as they wanted, this is where the name came from.
    Now we use Discord, but have kept the same iconic name.
