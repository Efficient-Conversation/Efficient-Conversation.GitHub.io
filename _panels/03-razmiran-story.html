<h4>Story</h4>
<h5>Kassen, Nirmathas</h5>
<p>
    <strong>Crannor, Glanel, Virilion, and Erin join the party.</strong><br />
    The story starts in a small town known as Kassen when bandits try to shakedown the townsfolk. 
    Four adventurers: Crannor, Glanel, Virilion, and Erin are hired to take the fight to the bandits by the town.
    After Crannor screams an Orc war-cry the entire bandit camp lays down and cries, the towns small guard was then able to take care of them.
    Ereries (Human NPC and former bandit) decides to join the party. Afterwards we are informed by the towns Mayor that there is an ancient crypt near the town.
    Investigating the crypt, the party finds pillow pits, an arrow pillar thing, and an ancient Lich. The Lich sucks and gets his arms ripped off instantly and cut in half.
    The party finds an ancient sword in the crypt, meanwhile Glanel accidentally punches a dead body. Crannor knocks him out.
    The party returns to Kassen where they try to get an appraisal on the ancient sword looted in the crypt. The town blacksmith knows nothing about it.
    Glanel attempts an appraise check on it, and immediately botches, snapping the sword in half. 
    Glanel spots a masterwork axe and attempts to steal it, however is caught and thrown out of the shop in the process.
    Crannor buys a new great hammer, and Glannel challenges him to a fight with it. Immediately getting knocked out with it.
    The party receives a letter from the Pathfinder society asking them to come to Tamran, as they would like to hire them for a job.
